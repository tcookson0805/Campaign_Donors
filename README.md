# [Campaign Donors](https://campaign-donors.herokuapp.com/)

Campaign Donors is a straight forward app that allows its users to discover who donates money to specific candidates and causes.

# Overview

Campaign Donors provides its users an interface to tap into data maintained by the Federal Election Commission. Users are able to use a dropdown navigation to search by either a person's name or by a person's hometown. An advanced search option is also available that can narrow the user's search to specific dates donations were made and amounts.

# Technical

The front-end utilizes jQuery and is styled with the Materialize CSS framework. The backe-end is built on NodeJS using a simple ExpressJS web server. Search queries result in data retrieved and reformatted from the Federal Election Commission's OpenFEC API, which is still in beta.
